# Stickup Sticky Navigation
_a jQuery plugin_

Here's a script that adds a sticky nav with a twist:
* The nav disappears as you scroll down.
* As you scroll up, it reappears, no matter how far down you're scrolled.

Have a look at the [demo](http://tcmulder.github.io/stickup-nav/demo/index.html) or play around with the code on [codepen](http://codepen.io/tcmulder/pen/blzrc).
